# CodingInterview
My prep material and practice questions for an interview for embedded or low-level systems.  

This repository will include answers to some basic systems related questions, definitions of terms, as well as some coding problems involving some low-level data structures and a slight touch on a couple dynamic programming questions (just in case).
